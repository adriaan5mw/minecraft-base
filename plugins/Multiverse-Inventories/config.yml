# This is where you configure your world groups
# example below: 
#    groups:
#      example_group:
#        worlds:
#        - world1
#        - world2
#        shares:
#        - all
# In this example, world1 and world2 will share everything sharable.
# When things are shared this means they are the SAME for each world listed in the group.
# Options for shares: inventory, exp, health, hunger, beds
# Worlds not listed in a group will have a separate personal inventory/stats/bed.
